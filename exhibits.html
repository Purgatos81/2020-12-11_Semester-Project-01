                    species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive

                For centuries, philosophers and scientists have
                wrestled with the question of our origins.
                Where do we come from and how did we get here?
                Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we
                have had a framework for exploring and understanding
                our place in this world.

                You can also take some time to meet a few of the
                creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly

                From micro-organisms to the human body, major
                breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique
                insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.

                For many people their life expectancy is much
                longer and their quality of life much improved,
                thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine.
                Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of
                medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs
                including the discovery of penicillin and the first
                heart transplant.

                Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come
                not only from the lab, but also from observing animals
                in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.
